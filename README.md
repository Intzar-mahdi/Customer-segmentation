# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment mall customers based on their purchasing behavior. It aims to help businesses understand customer profiles and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## 📁 Project File

- `Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data analysis, visualization, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income`
- `Spending Score`
- (or similar features depending on the version used)

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution plots
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Boxplots and scatterplots

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values (if any)
   - Standardization or normalization

3. **Clustering Algorithms**
   - K-Means Clustering
   - Elbow Method to find optimal `k`
   - Silhouette Score analysis

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
   - t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

5. **Visualization**
   - Clustered customer groups
   - 2D and 3D visual plots of clusters
   - Pie charts of segment distribution

## 🧠 Objective

To group customers into distinct segments based on similar traits and purchasing behavior, enabling personalized marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Intzar-mahdi/Customer-segmentation.git
